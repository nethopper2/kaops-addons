  # Mateusz: Clean me up :) Looking to be able to show messaging on the FE after an Addon is added
  #          from the marketplace. Or could be used for enforcement if needed. Better way to describe this?
  installTargets:
    # This would mean it CAN be installed on the hub (would this ever be false?)
    hub: true
    # This would mean the agent immediately automatically installs on the hub when the Addon is added to the Network.
    hubRequired: true
    # This would mean the user should be allowed to choose to install on chosen edges when true.
